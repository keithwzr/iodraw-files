        "A small company with six vans has a contract with a number of airlines to pick up lost or delayed baggage, belonging to customers in the London area, from Heathrow airport at 6 p.m. each evening. The contract stipulates that each customer must have their baggage delivered by 8 p.m. The company requires a model to advise them what is the minimum number of vans they need to use and to which customers each van should deliver and in what order. There is no practical capacity limitation on each van. Each van can hold all baggage that needs to be delivered in a two-hour period. To solve this problem, we can formulate an optimization model that minimizes the number of vans that need to be used.\n",
